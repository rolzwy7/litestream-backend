litestreaming-backend is a very simple streaming service capable of
sharing video streams in MPEG-DASH format in safe way using JWT tokens.

litestreaming-backend is aiming to be as minimalistic as possible.

# How it works

First generate URL to manifest.mpd file with endpoint (you need to provide password for that):
POST /stream/access/:stream_id
Body (JSON):
{
    "password": "<password here>"
}

Then "player_url" parameters can be used by any MPEG-DASH player.
"player_url" is an endpoint URL:
GET /stream/proxy/:jwt_token/:filename

JWT token is a guard for access.

# Configuration

You only need to configure .env file.

Set your own password, secret for jwt signing and absolute url address of your service.

# Media folder

Directly in `media` folder there should be a directory which name is `stream_id`.
Inside this folder there should be JSON file called `chapters.js`, for example:
[
  {
    "title": "Some title for this chapter",
    "duration": {
      "h": 0,
      "m": 15,
      "s": 46
    },
    "dir": "chapter_1"
  },
  ... more ...
]

So the chapter item looks like this:
{
    "title": "Some title for this chapter",
    "duration": {
      "h": 0,
      "m": 15,
      "s": 46
    },
    "dir": "chapter_1"
}

It can have additional filed like "subtitles" array saved in subtitles/subtitles.json:
[
    {
      src: 'public/example-media/subtitles/en.vtt',
      kind: 'subtitles',
      language: 'en',
      label: 'English',
      contentType: 'text/vtt',
    }
]


For every "dir" key there should be a directory whit the "dir" name (for example "chapter_1").
Those dirs contain all MPEG-DASH files: manifest, audio and video segments.
